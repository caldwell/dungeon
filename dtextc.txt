#################### Dungeon Text Data File ####################

How this file works
===================

This file is formatted such that encode.rb can parse it with fairly simple
regular expressions. Each entry starts with `## <id>` and ends at the next
entry (or end of file). The last newline in each entry is just so this file
looks good and is stripped when the file is read.

The `<id>` is a negative integer.

This integer corresponds with the original dtextc.dat file. The original
code used to do `(-id - 1) * 8` to find the offset in the encrypted raw text
area. These ids were referenced by numerous places in the various data
structures (room descriptions for instance). These ids are now purely
logical, so that the rest of the data can remain the same even if lengths
change in here.

The line following the '##' is the start of the actual text data.  The text
data is "smartly" unwrapped in html mode, and mostly left verbatim in text
mode. There are some light markup elements to help wtih html formatting:

Alignment
---------

These all strip the affected text before aligning it.

    {>   Some text  }   Right justifies "Some text"
    {<   Some text}     Left justifies "Some text"
    {= Some text  }     Centers "Some text"

Verbatim
--------

This is for the various ascii art (looks and acts like markdown):

    ```
           Anything in here is meant
                     to look exactly
           as it appears
    ```

Conditionals
------------

These all remove trailing linefeeds after their closing tags. The tags are
cumbersome so that they can wrap around Alignment and Verbatim blocks and
still be parsed relatively easily. They cannot be nested themselves,
however.

    {HTML nested text/markup HTML} Only outputs in html mode
    {TEXT nested text/markup TEXT} Only outputs in text mode
    {# Some comment #}             Never outputs

Non-breaking space
------------------

Outside of verbatim blocks, `_` is a non-breaking space. Html will make it
`&nbsp;` and text mode will just make it ` `. (Currently there's only one
use of `_` and it's wrappend in a `{HTML HTML}` conditional.)

This Documentation
------------------

Due to a quirk of the encoder.rb parser, all text up to the first entry is
ignored. A perfect spot for some impromtu documentation. :-)

Useful commands:

   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
command restores long descriptions.
   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
of what the game is about.
   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
to continue playing.
   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.

Command abbreviations:

   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.

Containment:

   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
to see such an object, the container must be either open or
transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
one level down.

Fighting:

   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.

Command parser:

   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.

   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
the following types of things--

   Actions:
	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
	PUT DOWN, etc.

   Directions:
	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
	only certain situations.

   Objects:
	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.

   Adjectives:
	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
	DOORs, BUTTONs).

   Prepositions:
	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
	WITH DEMON' won't parse.

   Sentences:
	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
	can be placed on the same line.

   Ambiguity:
	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.

Welcome to Dungeon!

   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
case in the living room of the house.

   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
is rumored to be useful.

   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

## -832
Please answer the question.

## -836
You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
may gloat over them.

## -865
What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.

## -882
Now let me see...
Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
everything.

## -895
Do you wish me to try to patch you?

## -900
You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
there is a window which is #.

## -912
open

## -913
slightly ajar

## -915
You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
east is a small window which is #.

## -945
You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
nailed shut.

## -964
You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
strange gothic lettering.

## -985
In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.

## -992
In the center of the room is a closed trap door.

## -999
In the center of the room is an open trap door.

## -1005
There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.

## -1011
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.

## -1033
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

## -1040
You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
passages in the immediate vicinity.

## -1052
Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.

## -1060
Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.

## -1067
Above you is a grating.

## -1070
You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
and south.

## -1080
There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.

## -1087
There is an open grating descending into darkness.

## -1094
A grating appears on the ground.

## -1099
You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.

## -1107
You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
a wide stream running through the center of the room.

## -1130
There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
climbing up along the edge of a cliff.

## -1143
You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.

## -1166
You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.

## -1182
You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.

## -1190
You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
a wide stream running through the center of the room.

## -1215
There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.

## -1222
You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.

## -1238
Part of the glacier has been melted.

## -1243
There is a large passageway leading westward.

## -1249
You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.

## -1273
Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
actions.

## -1282
{=		BOOOOOOOOOM}

## -1284
You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.

## -1343
closed

## -1344
The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.

## -1353
You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.

## -1361
In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
is obviously deranged and holding his nose.

## -1375
A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
from the ceiling and lifts you away...

## -1388
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
wooden railing which circles the dome.

## -1410
Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
from the floor below.

## -1421
I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.

## -1428
You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.

## -1469
A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
five feet above your head.

## -1481
You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.

## -1490
Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.

## -1499
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.

## -1525
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:

{=	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."}

The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.

## -1559
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
attempts to pass.

## -1570
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.

## -1594
You are not equipped for an exorcism.

## -1599
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
of a greater power, flee through the walls.

## -1620
You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.

## -1666
Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.

## -1680
You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
to the north, south, east, and down.

## -1701
The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
the lake.

## -1719
It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
stream through the gates.

## -1740
There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

## -1756
The green bubble is glowing.

## -1760
The water level is now up to your ankles.

## -1766
The water level is now up to your shins.

## -1772
The water level is now up to your knees.

## -1778
The water level is now up to your hips.

## -1783
The water level is now up to your waist.

## -1789
The water level is now up to your chest.

## -1795
The water level is now up to your neck.

## -1800
The water level is now over your head.

## -1805
The water level is now high in your lungs.

## -1811
The room is full of water and cannot be entered.

## -1818
I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.

## -1824
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.

## -1840
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
suddenly vanish.

## -1850
Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.

## -1857
Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
smart thing to do, apparently.

## -1869
You seem to be digging a hole here.

## -1874
The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.

## -1881
You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.

## -1888
You can see a small statue in the sand.

## -1893
The wall collapses, smothering you.

## -1898
There is nothing to dig into here.

## -1903
You are digging into a pile of bat guano.

## -1909
You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.

## -1915
You are covered with bat turds, cretin.

## -1920
This is getting you nowhere.

## -1924
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.

## -1948
A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.

## -1956
A solid rainbow spans the falls.

## -1961
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.

## -1993
You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
below to the floor.

## -2012
The way to the south is blocked by rubble.

## -2018
There is a small door to the south.

## -2023
You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
for an exit on the north side.

## -2036
Embedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
chipped out of the front of it.

## -2056
On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.

## -2064
You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
There are exits to the east and southeast.

## -2078
As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.

## -2085
The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.

## -2092
The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.

## -2099
The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.

## -2108
The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.

## -2115
The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
ground.  Fatally.

## -2135
The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.

## -2141
You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
dungeon has collapsed.

## -2161
The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
turning you into a pancake.

## -2172
The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
turning you into a pancake.

## -2184
A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.

## -2217
Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

## -2293
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.

## -2301
The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.

## -2317
The lid opens.

## -2319
The lid closes.

## -2321
Look around.

## -2323
You think it isn't?

## -2326
I think you've already done that.

## -2331
The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
attempt by robbers to remove it).

## -2344
The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.

## -2350
The basket is at the other end of the chain.

## -2356
A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.

## -2362
The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.

## -2370
The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.

## -2378
It is not tied to anything.

## -2382
There is nothing it can be tied to.

## -2387
The rope is already attached.

## -2391
The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

## -2400
I see no objects here.

## -2403
Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.

## -2411
The rope drops gently to the floor below.

## -2417
The rope is tied to the railing.

## -2422
The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.

## -2431
The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
notice an irregularity beneath it.

## -2443
The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.

## -2450
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.

## -2467
Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
to move it again.

## -2477
You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.

## -2483
Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.

## -2490
The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.

## -2506
Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.

## -2522
There is an explosion nearby.

## -2526
The wire rapidly burns into nothing.

## -2531
The match has gone out.

## -2534
The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.

## -2539
The lamp is dying.

## -2542
The candles grow short.

## -2545
The candles are very short.

## -2549
The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.

## -2556
The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
the neighbors that they come over and put you out.

## -2571
As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
of blinding blue light.

## -2582
As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
savagely cuts your throat.

## -2611
A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.

## -2642
There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.

## -2651
There is an ugly person staring at you.

## -2656
The mirror is broken into many pieces.

## -2661
Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.

## -2670
You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
good luck available.

## -2682
Haven't you done enough already?

## -2687
The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
there is a passageway leading west.

## -2717
The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
you in the dark.

## -2728
The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.

## -2735
Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.

## -2744
burned out ivory torch

## -2747
There is a burned out ivory torch here.

## -2752
The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.

## -2758
The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.

## -2765
The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.

## -2772
You seem unable to affect these spirits.

## -2778
How can you attack a spirit with material objects?

## -2785
The book is open to page 569.

## -2789
As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.

## -2795
A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
have turned into a pile of dust.

## -2808
I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.

## -2814
One of the matches starts to burn.

## -2819
The match is out.

## -2822
The tube refuses to accept anything.

## -2827
The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.

## -2835
The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."

## -2851
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.

## -2877
The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
put in that drink, anyway?).

## -2890
The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
your generous gesture.

## -2901
The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.

## -2908
The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!

## -2914
The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.

## -2919
The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.

## -2926
The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.

## -2934
The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
condiments for his upcoming snack.

## -2948
The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.

## -2956
You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.

## -2963
Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.

## -2979
The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.

## -2987
The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.

## -2996
You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.

## -3004
Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.

## -3019
Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.

## -3033
worthless piece of canvas

## -3037
There is a worthless piece of canvas here.

## -3043
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.

## -3052
The window closes (more easily than it opened).

## -3058
The bolt won't turn with your best effort.

## -3064
The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.

## -3071
The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.

## -3080
You can't do that!

## -3083
The grating is locked.

## -3086
The grating opens to reveal trees above you.

## -3092
The grating opens.

## -3095
The grating is unlocked.

## -3099
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
into darkness.

## -3110
The door swings shut and closes.

## -3115
The door is locked from above.

## -3119
The door cannot be opened.

## -3123
You cannot burn this door.

## -3127
The door is invulnerable.

## -3131
You cannot damage this door.

## -3135
The door is still under warranty.

## -3140
The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
excitement fades.

## -3159
The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.

## -3166
A force keeps you from taking the bodies.

## -3172
The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.

## -3190
The lights within the room shut off.

## -3195
The lights within the room come on.

## -3200
Click.

## -3201
There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
in a pipe).

## -3219
The blue button appears to be jammed.

## -3224
The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.

## -3230
The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.

## -3236
You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.

## -3242
This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.

## -3250
Well done.  The boat is repaired.

## -3255
There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.

## -3261
The boat deflates.

## -3264
You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.

## -3270
The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.

## -3276
Very good.

## -3278
The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.

## -3286
Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).

## -3302
The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
by water vapor.

## -3320
The ballon is fastened to the hook.

## -3325
The balloon is not tied to anything.

## -3330
The wire falls off the hook.

## -3334
The box is embedded in the wall.

## -3339
What do you expect, BOOM?

## -3343
The box has no door!

## -3346
The box is rusted and will not open.

## -3351
The box is not open, chomper!

## -3355
The wire starts to burn.

## -3359
"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
from sight.

## -3392
"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
the # in his rock hard hands.

## -3404
The gnome appears increasingly nervous.

## -3409
Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
prevent this.

## -3427
Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
of your life.

## -3446
Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.

## -3464
As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
into the room.

## -3483
As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.

## -3515
There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.

## -3522
Nothing seems to happen.

## -3526
The whirring increases in intensity slightly.

## -3532
The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.

## -3538
A dull thump is heard in the distance.

## -3543
The flask breaks into pieces.

## -3547
Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.

## -3552
Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
flask's contents are fatal.

## -3564
Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.

## -3571
The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
be clearly visible.

## -3582
You can't see through that!

## -3586
The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.

## -3594
The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".

## -3599
The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".

## -3605
The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".

## -3610
The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.

## -3618
The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
with blasting cakes.

## -3637
You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).

## -3645
The room around you seems to be getting smaller.

## -3652
The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
more or less demolished.

## -3671
The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.

## -3688
How romantic!

## -3690
If you must... Poof, you're dead!

## -3695
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
to tell the tale.

## -3730
There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!

## -3748
The bucket rises and comes to a stop.

## -3753
The bucket descends and comes to a stop.

## -3759
You notice that the # has burned out, and that
the cloth bag is starting to deflate.

## -3770
I hope you have more light than from a #.

## -3776
I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
there is still justice in the world.

## -3795
Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.

## -3812
There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.

## -3818
The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.

## -3826
You won't melt it with a #.

## -3830
The bolt can't be turned with your #.

## -3835
It seems that a # won't do.

## -3839
With a #?

## -3841
The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
appendage in thanks.

## -3850
A #?  Surely you jest.

## -3853
He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.

## -3869
You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.

## -3876
I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.

## -3883
At your service!

## -3886
The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.

## -3895
Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!

## -3900
It could very well be too late.

## -3904
The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).

## -3911
Naturally!

## -3913
AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!

## -3917
Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.

## -3923
Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?

## -3929
Are you enjoying yourself?

## -3933
Wheeeeee!

## -3935
Do you expect me to applaud?

## -3939
Such language in a high-class establishment like this!

## -3946
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

## -3951
It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.

## -3958
Tough shit, asshole.

## -3961
Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!

## -3969
That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.

## -3975
I think you are taking this thing for granite.

## -3981
Brief descriptions.

## -3984
Maximum verbosity.

## -3987
No long descriptions.

## -3990
You can see:  A #.

## -3993
Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.

## -3999
I don't really see how.

## -4002
I think that swimming is best performed in water.

## -4009
Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.

## -4015
Wasn't he an Indian?

## -4018
I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.

## -4043
Wasn't he a sailor?

## -4046
The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.

## -4062
There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.

## -4069
Well what?

## -4071
If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.

## -4078
Nothing happens.

## -4081
I don't really know how to do that.

## -4086
Do you wish to leave the game?

## -4090
Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.

## -4096
Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.

## -4102
Hello.

## -4103
Good day.

## -4105
Nice weather we've been having lately.

## -4110
Goodbye.

## -4112
Here, nothing happens.

## -4115
Nothing happens here.

## -4118
I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.

## -4124
You seem to be repeating yourself.

## -4129
The # bows his head to you in greeting.

## -4134
I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.

## -4141
It is impossible to read in the dark.

## -4146
How does one look through a #?

## -4150
How can I read a #?

## -4153
How, exactly, do I ring that?

## -4157
Ding, dong.

## -4159
I'm not sure that a # can be melted.

## -4164
If you wish, but I can't understand why.

## -4170
Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
you want to brush them with.

## -4182
A nice idea, but with a #?

## -4186
Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
and you die of respiratory failure.

## -4208
Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.

## -4214
Inflating it further would probably burst it.

## -4220
How can you inflate that?

## -4224
Come on, now!

## -4226
The # isn't sleeping.

## -4229
This has no effect.

## -4232
does not seem to do anything useful

## -4237
is not notably useful

## -4240
isn't very interesting

## -4243
doesn't appear worthwhile

## -4247
has no effect

## -4249
doesn't do anything

## -4252
Kicking a # #.

## -4254
Waving a # #.

## -4256
Playing in this way with a # #.

## -4260
Fiddling with a # #.

## -4263
Pushing the # #.

## -4266
I don't think so.

## -4269
This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!

## -4275
How can you tie that to anything?

## -4280
You can't tie the # to that.

## -4284
You could certainly never tie the # with that!

## -4290
The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.

## -4296
Why would you tie up a #?

## -4300
You can't turn that.

## -4303
You certainly can't turn it with a #.

## -4308
Digging with the # is slow and tedious.

## -4313
Digging with a # is silly.

## -4317
I don't think that anybody is home.

## -4322
Why knock on a #?

## -4325
It sounds like there is something inside the #.

## -4331
The contents of the # spill out.

## -4336
I can't get to that to move it.

## -4340
You can't move the #.

## -4343
You can't turn that on.

## -4346
It is already on.

## -4349
You can't turn that off.

## -4353
It is already off.

## -4356
The # is now on.

## -4359
The # is now off.

## -4362
It is now pitch black.

## -4365
You must tell me how to do that to a #.

## -4370
The # cannot be opened.

## -4373
Opened.

## -4374
Opening the # reveals:

## -4377
The # cannot be closed.

## -4380
It is already open.

## -4383
It is already closed.

## -4386
Closed.

## -4387
There is a # here.

## -4390
You are carrying a #.

## -4393
It is in the #, which is in the room.

## -4398
It is in the #, which you are carrying.

## -4403
Time passes...

## -4405
The # must be on the ground to be boarded.

## -4411
I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.

## -4417
You are already in the #, cretin!

## -4422
You are now in the #.

## -4425
You aren't in that!

## -4428
You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
be fatal.

## -4438
You are on your own feet again.

## -4442
You can't go there without a vehicle.

## -4447
You can't go there in a #.

## -4451
I see nothing special about the #.

## -4456
It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

## -4464
You are in the #.

## -4467
The # has died.

## -4469
The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
the guttural tongue of the trolls.

## -4482
The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
bloody axe.

## -4491
An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
of the room are open.

## -4502
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
out of the room.

## -4513
The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.

## -4520
The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".

## -4528
The troll laughs at your puny gesture.

## -4533
The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #

## -4540
The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift

## -4548
and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.

## -4557
and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
not look pleased.

## -4576
Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.

## -4580
You can't take the #.

## -4583
Aren't you forgetting something?

## -4588
That would be a good trick.

## -4592
The # is too big to jump over.

## -4596
You should have looked before you leaped.

## -4602
I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.

## -4610
In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.

## -4619
Geronimo...

## -4621
I don't think that the # would agree with you.

## -4627
I think you should get that first.

## -4632
Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.

## -4638
How can I drink that?

## -4641
I'd like to, but I can't get to that.

## -4646
Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
this talking.

## -4656
The # catches fire.

## -4659
Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.

## -4665
You don't have that.

## -4668
The # catches fire and is consumed.

## -4673
I don't think you can burn a #.

## -4677
It doesn't seem to work.

## -4681
Can you unlock a grating with a #?

## -4686
Munging a # #.

## -4688
Trying to kill a # #.

## -4691
Trying to attack a # #.

## -4694
There is nothing here to attack.

## -4699
I've known strange people, but attacking a #?

## -4705
with your bare hands is suicidal

## -4710
with that is very self-destructive

## -4715
You are in perfect health.

## -4719
You have a light wound.

## -4722
You have a serious wound.

## -4726
You have several wounds.

## -4730
You have serious wounds.

## -4734
You are at death's door.

## -4738
You can be killed by one more light wound.

## -4744
You can be killed by a serious wound.

## -4749
You can survive one serious wound.

## -4754
You are strong enough to take several wounds.

## -4760
You have been killed once.

## -4764
You have been killed twice.

## -4768
This gives you the rank of Cheater.

## -4773
This gives you the rank of Wizard.

## -4778
This gives you the rank of Master.

## -4783
This gives you the rank of Winner.

## -4788
This gives you the rank of Hacker.

## -4793
This gives you the rank of Adventurer.

## -4798
This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.

## -4804
This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.

## -4810
This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.

## -4816
This gives you the rank of Beginner.

## -4821
Your sword is no longer glowing.

## -4826
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

## -4832
You sword has begun to glow very brightly.

## -4838
Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.

## -4852
The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
recovers his stilletto.

## -4863
His booty remains.

## -4866
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
treasures reappear:  A #.

## -4877
  A #.

## -4878
There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.

## -4895
There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.

## -4910
The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.

## -4925
Once you got him, what would you do with him?

## -4931
You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
seem angered by your attempt.

## -4952
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.

## -4962
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.

## -4977
Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.

## -4984
The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
stupid as you are?

## -4995
The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.

## -5003
The candles are not lit.

## -5007
The flame is extinguished.

## -5011
Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
burn.

## -5021
With what?

## -5023
The candles are lit.

## -5026
The candles are already lit.

## -5030
You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.

## -5038
You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.

## -5046
The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.

## -5055
Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.

## -5063
Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.

## -5072
You can't go that way.

## -5075
The # is closed.

## -5078
I can't reach that.

## -5081
You aren't carrying that.

## -5085
Dropped.

## -5087
Thrown.

## -5088
You watch as the balloon slowly lands.

## -5093
The balloon has landed.

## -5096
You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.

## -5103
You watch as the balloon slowly descends.

## -5109
The balloon descends.

## -5112
You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.

## -5121
Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?

## -5138
You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.

## -5144
The balloon ascends.

## -5147
You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
due to its light load.

## -5159
The balloon leaves the ledge.

## -5163
You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.

## -5169
The balloon slowly rises from the ground.

## -5175
The cloth bag is draped over the side.

## -5180
The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
in the receptacle.

## -5189
The balloon is tied to the hook.

## -5194
I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.

## -5201
You are tied to the ledge.

## -5205
You don't really want to hold a burning #.

## -5211
The receptacle is already occupied.

## -5216
The # burns inside the receptacle.

## -5221
The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.

## -5227
Not likely.

## -5229
An interesting idea, but...

## -5233
A valiant attempt.

## -5236
You can't be serious.

## -5239
Not a prayer.

## -5241
You already have it.

## -5244
Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.

## -5253
Taken.

## -5254
Nice try.

## -5256
I can't do that.

## -5259
I can't reach inside.

## -5262
How can you do that?

## -5265
The # is already in the #.

## -5269
It won't fit.

## -5271
I can't reach the #.

## -5274
The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.

## -5280
"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."

## -5289
"My vision is not that good without eyes."

## -5295
"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."

## -5303
ECHO
The acoustics of the room change subtly.

## -5309
Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.

## -5327
The # contains:

## -5329
Your collection of treasures consists of:

## -5335
You are carrying:

## -5338
The # is carrying:

## -5341
By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
stop the leak in the dam.

## -5352
You are empty handed.

## -5355
It is too dark in here to see.

## -5359
#:

## -5360
I could't find anything.

## -5364
I couldn't find any valuables.

## -5368
Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
the bag will be taken only over his dead body.

## -5391
Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.

## -5416
The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
Fortunately, he took nothing.

## -5427
A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
nothing of value, he left disgruntled.

## -5440
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
others before...".

## -5468
The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
left disgusted.

## -5479
The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
have noticed that he robbed you blind first.

## -5493
Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
fine # is doing here?"

## -5505
You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.

## -5515
Attacking a dead # is pointless.

## -5520
Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?

## -5528
The # slowly regains his feet.

## -5532
The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.

## -5539
It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
that you are dead.

## -5550
Saved.

## -5551
I can't access the save file.

## -5555
Restored.

## -5557
Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.

## -5564
I don't understand that.

## -5568
You cannot talk to that!

## -5572
You cannot talk through another person.

## -5577
Please input the entire command again.

## -5582
Fortunately, you still have a #.

## -5587
You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
leading up.

## -5597
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
friendly, though he likes people.

## -5625
The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
a cyclops.

## -5644
The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.

## -5660
The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
blissfully at the foot of the stairs.

## -5674
On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.

## -5688
The bottle is closed.

## -5691
The bottle is already full.

## -5695
The bottle is now full of water.

## -5700
The water slips through your fingers.

## -5705
Too many prepositions.

## -5708
Too many objects.

## -5711
I can't see one here.

## -5714
Which one do you mean?

## -5717
I can't reach that from inside the #.

## -5722
What should I do with the #?

## -5726
Huh?

## -5727
You must supply a direct object.

## -5732
You must supply an indirect object.

## -5737
Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
Please let me express my profoundest regrets.

## -5760
The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
your greeting with his usual graciousness.

## -5774
The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
the # and stops to admire its beauty.

## -5788
The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.

## -5795
The # is empty.

## -5797
I don't know how to look inside a #.

## -5802
There is nothing interesting there.

## -5807
The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.

## -5815
You can't wind a #.

## -5818
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

## -5825
A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."

## -5858
An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.

## -5907
The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
leaving you alone in the bare room.

## -5929
Talk about eating rich foods!

## -5933
Nothing like having money to burn!

## -5938
"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
understated "pop".

## -5958
The gnome carefully places the # in the
deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.

## -5990
The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
fingers, leaving you alone.

## -6002
The gnome appears increasingly impatient.

## -6008
There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.

## -6016
The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.

## -6025
The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.

## -6072
The cliff is too steep for climbing.

## -6077
The egg is already open.

## -6081
There is no obvious way to open the egg.

## -6087
I doubt you could do that without damaging it.

## -6093
The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.

## -6106
The concept of using a # is certainly original.

## -6112
Not to say that using a # isn't original either...

## -6119
You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
The egg is now open.

## -6131
Climbing the walls is of no avail.

## -6136
Bizarre!

## -6138
The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.

## -6145
The # falls to the ground.

## -6149
You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.

## -6165
On the ground below you can see:

## -6170
I can't see any wall here.

## -6174
That cannot be turned.

## -6177
You would be lost without me.

## -6181
You don't have the #.

## -6184
The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.

## -6191
I can't see any song bird here.

## -6195
You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...

## -6202
You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.

## -6210
You can't go more than part way through the curtain.

## -6217
That would involve quite a contortion!

## -6222
You are in it, turkey!

## -6225
As you try, your hand seems to go through it.

## -6231
The # goes through it.

## -6234
The # passes through the wall and vanishes.

## -6240
The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.

## -6247
I can't do that with everything at once.

## -6253
There is a wall there.

## -6256
There is no way up.

## -6259
There is no way down.

## -6262
You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
which is engraved a compass rose.

## -6292
Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
around formidable bludgeons.

## -6330
Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
around formidable bludgeons.

## -6368
A passage enters from the south.

## -6373
The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.

## -6389
To the north and south are large hallways.

## -6395
To the north is a large hallway.

## -6400
You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a

## -6563
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
the stone floor.

## -6574
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.

## -6588
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.

## -6612
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.

## -6627
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
above the stone channel in the floor.

## -6641
   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing #.

You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
end, inches above the floor.

## -6710
You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
room by a # lying on the floor.

## -6740
Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
crypt to the south.  The door is #.

## -6779
You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.

## -6803
In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
which is #.

## -6813
You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.

## -6830
You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.

## -6839
The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
panel is #, and the door is #.

## -6852
You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is #.

## -6891
You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "#".

## -6984
You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
in front of you.

## -7003
You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.

## -7018
Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.

## -7025
You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
its small window.

## -7044
You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
which seems to be #.

## -7072
   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

## -7155
Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
	INCANT, <word>
and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
	INCANT, <phrase>
Good luck, and choose wisely!"

## -7227
The button pops back to its original position.

## -7233
The mirror quietly swings shut.

## -7237
The pine wall closes quietly.

## -7241
The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.

## -7247
The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.

## -7254
The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.

## -7261
The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.

## -7267
The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.

## -7275
The pine wall swings open.

## -7279
The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.

## -7287
The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
budge.

## -7296
The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.

## -7304
The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.

## -7312
The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.

## -7320
The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
suspicions are aroused.

## -7331
Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
resume their posts.

## -7359
A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
are aroused.

## -7370
Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.

## -7393
The statues are impassive.

## -7397
The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
completes you crumble into dust.

## -7427
"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"

## -7435
The pole is now slightly above the floor.

## -7441
The pole cannot be raised further.

## -7446
The pole cannot be lowered further.

## -7451
The pole is lowered into the channel.

## -7456
The pole is lowered into the stone hole.

## -7462
The pole is already resting on the floor.

## -7468
The pole now rests on the stone floor.

## -7473
The button becomes depressed.

## -7477
The button pops back out.

## -7481
The button is already depressed.

## -7486
No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.

## -7493
The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.

## -7500
You can't break the beam with a #.

## -7505
The # already breaks the beam.

## -7509
I see no bronze door here.

## -7513
The bronze door opens.

## -7516
The bronze door closes.

## -7519
On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
into a larger area.

## -7530
The door won't budge.

## -7533
The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
admit you to these regions.
   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."

## -7650
The booming voice asks:

## -7653
"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
through the cyclops room?"

## -7665
"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"

## -7674
"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
treasures, in Zorkmids?"

## -7685
"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"

## -7694
"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"

## -7701
"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"

## -7708
"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"

## -7714
"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"

## -7721
The door is securely fastened.

## -7725
The wooden door opens.

## -7728
The wooden door closes.

## -7731
The dungeon master says, "I will stay."

## -7736
The dungeon master says, "I will follow."

## -7742
There is no reply.

## -7745
"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."

## -7751
"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."

## -7757
"I cannot perform that action for you."

## -7762
This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.

## -7768
This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.

## -7774
This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.

## -7780
This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.

## -7786
You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
cryptic inscription:

{=		"Feel Free".}

## -7829
The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.

## -7837
The crypt is already open.

## -7841
The crypt is already closed.

## -7845
The crypt is closed.

## -7848
The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".

## -7855
There is no answer.

## -7858
No one seems to be listening.

## -7862
The dungeon master says, "Excellent."

## -7867
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."

## -7876
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."

## -7885
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."

## -7894
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."

## -7903
The mirror is closed.

## -7906
You must specify what to set the dial to.

## -7912
The dial face contains only numbers.

## -7917
The dial now points to "#".

## -7921
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.

## -7928
The cell door is now closed.

## -7932
You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.

## -7939
The dungeon master catches up with you.

## -7944
The dungeon master follows you.

## -7948
There is a wooden wall blocking your way.

## -7954
There is a large mirror blocking your way.

## -7960
There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.

## -7967
The structure blocks your way.

## -7971
As you leave, the door swings shut.

## -7976
You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.

## -7984
You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.

## -7992
You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
which once contained a mirror.

## -8004
You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
which once contained a mirror.

## -8016
The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.

## -8024
The panel has been opened outward.

## -8029
The opposite wall is solid rock.

## -8034
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
With that, he departs.

## -8062
The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.

## -8087
Saves are not permitted during the endgame.

## -8093
Restores are not permitted during the endgame.

## -8099
The structure rotates clockwise.

## -8104
The structure rotates counterclockwise.

## -8109
I can't see a mirror here.

## -8113
I don't see any way to open the mirror here.

## -8119
The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.

## -8125
The mirror has already been broken.

## -8130
The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
fragile.

## -8148
The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.

## -8155
I can't see a panel here.

## -8159
I don't see any way to open the panel here.

## -8165
To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.

The panel is not that easily destroyed.

The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
when you let go.

Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.

## -8264
That incantation seems to have been a failure.

## -8270
Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.

## -8276
That spell has no obvious effect.

## -8281
As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.

door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
{=	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"}

## -8348
The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
now atomized, spews through the slot.

Come, come!

## -8459
There is only a passage in that direction.

## -8465
The wall does not budge.

## -8469
The wall slides forward and you follow it...
The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
and marble.  The following notations will be used:
			..  = current position (middle of grid)
			MM  = marble wall
			SS  = sandstone wall
			??  = unknown (blocked by walls).

## -8523
The wall slides forward and you follow it to the following position:

coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
north is a small opening.

## -10099
Slide Room

## -10101
You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,

	Round as a cup,
	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".

This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.

## -10624
Dam Lobby

## -10626
You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
room are in the west and south ends.

Strange Passage

## -10708
This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
created passage to the east.

## -10737
Treasure Room

## -10739
You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
could get back down.

## -10793
Studio

## -10794
You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
left through the north, south, or west exits.

Gallery

## -10818
You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
way downstream.

## -10855
Dam Base

## -10857
You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.

## -10873
Frigid River

## -10875
The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
prevent landing on the west.

## -10895
The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.

## -10921
You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
along the cliffs.

## -10940
White Cliffs Beach

## -10943
You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
narrow path leads north along the shore.

## -10957
The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.

## -10981
The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
shore is a large landing area.

## -10994
Moby Lossage

## -10996
You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
quickly turning around a sharp corner.

## -11018
Shore

## -11019
You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.

## -11036
Sandy Beach

## -11038
You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.

Aragain Falls

## -11082
You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
travels east-west here.

## -11102
Rainbow room

## -11104
You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
continues to the southeast.

## -11142
End of rainbow

## -11144
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.

## -11169
Canyon Bottom

## -11171
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
climbable.

## -11205
Rocky Ledge

## -11207
You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only

You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.

## -11370

## -11374
You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.

## -11391

## -11394
You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.

## -11420
Narrow Ledge

## -11422
You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.

You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
above all the buttons says in English:

{=		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE}

There are exits to the west and the south.

You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of

final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the

{=		Flood Control Dam #3}

  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.

{=		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---}

This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.

This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
you have any problems, please report them to:

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids."

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No DECsystem should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
and was later translated to C.
